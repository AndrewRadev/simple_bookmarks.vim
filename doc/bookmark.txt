INSTALLATION                                   *simple-bookmarks-installation*

There are several ways to install the plugin. The recommended one is by using
Tim Pope's pathogen (http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332). In
that case, you can clone the plugin's git repository like so:
>
    git clone git://github.com/AndrewRadev/simple_bookmarks.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/simple_bookmarks
<
If your vim configuration is under git version control, you could also set up
the repository as a submodule, which would allow you to update more easily.
The command is (provided you're in ~/.vim):
>
    git submodule add git://github.com/AndrewRadev/simple_bookmarks.vim.git bundle/simple_bookmarks
<
Another way is to simply copy all the essential directories inside the ~/.vim
directory: plugin, autoload, doc.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                 *simple-bookmarks-usage*

The |:Bookmark| command accepts a name to store the bookmark. It will save the
current file and the cursor position to ~/.vim_bookmarks (by default).
Afterwards, you can use |:GotoBookmark| with a specific name to jump to that.
The command is tab-completed with all known names.

To delete a mark, use |:DelBookmark|. It works exactly the same as
|:GotoBookmark| -- it accepts the name of the mark, which is tab-completed.

If you'd like to view all your bookmarks, you can use |:CopenBookmarks| to
load them in the quickfix window.

Note that bookmarks should be synchronized between vim instances. Anytime you
add a mark in one vim instance, it should be available in all others. In
practice, this is achieved by simply reading and writing the whole file on
each update. I have yet to experiment to find out if there are any performance
issues or race conditions. If you find any issues, please open a bug report on
github: https://github.com/AndrewRadev/simple_bookmarks.vim/issues

COMMANDS                                           *simple-bookmarks-commands*

                                              *:Bookmark*
:Bookmark {name}     Saves the current file and cursor position as a bookmark
                     with the name {name}.

:GotoBookmark {name} Opens up the bookmark associated with the name {name}.
                     Restores the cursor position the way it was at the time
                     the bookmark was created. Tab-completed with all known
                     bookmark names.

                                              *:DelBookmark*
:DelBookmark {name}  Deletes the bookmark named {name}. Tab-completed with all
                     known bookmark names.

                                              *:CopenBookmarks*
:CopenBookmarks      Shows all bookmarks in the quickfix window.

SETTINGS                                           *simple-bookmarks-settings*

These are the variables that control the behaviour of the plugin.


                                                 *g:simple_bookmarks_filename*
>
    let g:simple_bookmarks_filename = '~/.vim_bookmarks'
<

Default value: '~/.vim_bookmarks'

This variable is the name of the file that stores the bookmarks. The actual
storage format is:
>
    bookmark name \t /path/to/file \t bufnum:lnum:col:off \t bookmarked line
<
In words, the four parts of a bookmark are tab-delimited, and the
second-to-last one, describing the cursor position, contains numbers that are
colon-delimited.


                                            *g:simple_bookmarks_long_quickfix*
>
    let g:simple_bookmarks_long_quickfix = 0
<

Default value: 0

The actual contents of the line are shown next to the bookmark's name. Setting
this variable to 1 would make them go underneath the line instead, making it
more readable, but possibly a bit more difficult to navigate.


                                                    *g:simple_bookmarks_signs*
>
    let g:simple_bookmarks_signs = 0
<

Default value: 0

Setting this variable to 1 would make the plugin place "->" signs on
bookmarked lines.


                                                *g:simple_bookmarks_highlight*
                                                *SimpleBookmark*
>
    let g:simple_bookmarks_highlight = 0
<

Default value: 0

Setting this variable to 1 would make the plugin highlight bookmarked lines.
The syntax group that's highlighted is |SimpleBookmark| and it's linked to
|Search| by default. If you want to customize it, you can use Vim's built-in
|:highlight| command.

                                               *g:simple_bookmarks_auto_close*
>
    let g:simple_bookmarks_auto_close = 1
<

Default value: 1

If this variable is set to 1, the plugin will automatically close the quickfix
window whenever a bookmark is chosen from it. Setting it to 0 disables this
special behaviour and leaves the quickfix window open.


                                                  *g:simple_bookmarks_new_tab*
>
    let g:simple_bookmarks_new_tab = 1
<

Default value: 0

If this variable is set to 1, the plugin will open bookmarks in a new tab
instead of using the standard quickfix window behaviour.

ISSUES                                               *simple-bookmarks-issues*

- Deletion doesn't prompt before removing a bookmark. Maybe it should.
- The storage mechanism is dead simple and it's possible to break it, though
  it seems unlikely.
